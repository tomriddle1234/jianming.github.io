Hi, I’m Jianming, welcome to my website vfxware.com. I’m currently a programmer working in the research institute CAS in Shanghai, before this I was living in Australia for several years. I come from both visual effects and programming background, I’m interested in implementing computer vision, image processing techniques for entertainment visual effects industry and other research fields.
