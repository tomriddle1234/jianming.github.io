Hi, I’m Jianming, welcome to my website vfxware.com. I'm currently teaching 3D and web development at Guangxi Arts University, before this I worked as a programmer and researcher in the CAS, Shanghai and CSIRO in Australia for many years. I come from both visual effects and programming background, I’m interested in implementing computer vision, image processing techniques for entertainment visual effects industry and other research fields. I used to working on 3D reconstruction of plants for plant phenomics researches, now I'm able to create art works using all the knowledge I learned.

Wish you can enjoy this site.

Jianming
