Welcome to my blog, and thank you for purchasing my app.

The 360 HDR Bracket Tool For Theta App I developed is intented to provide a lower cost convenient 3D or VFX on set production tool, working together with a RICOH Theta S or Theta SC 360 camera.

This app is capable of shooting multiple 360 images with wide range exposure level settings automatically, which is more than the official Theta App can do. It is designed for on set work, and has the logging function allowing post processing the images faster.
