I got involved in a data analysis project that needed a website with program genereated diagrams. Quickly after some research, I found echarts from Baidu.com, and D3.js are the most popular diagram plugins currently. Given sometime for my first experiements with these data visualization frameworks, I got some result [here](http://datanews.vfxware.com), in the end actually I acquired an award from it, lol. There were still lots of work left for this, but I'm glad that I worked it out, especially I'm happy with the [Async Programming](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-hero-async-programming-in-node-js/) technique part I learned. Later on I used Ionic, AngularJS and many more, will post these later.
