I was just searching the key words "visual effect programming language", interestingly I got the book as one of the result, *Computer Vision for Visual Effects* by Richard J. Radke. Then I think, Oh, *THIS IS WHAT I AM GOING TO DO*.

Further researches return me a presentation of the author, at [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn_RSaEa4n0). Maybe you can get the book from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Vision-Visual-Effects-Richard/dp/0521766877).

Wish all TD or VFX supervisors can realise how Computer Vision researches advanced the VFX industry in all these years. CV covers the digital image processing, which is highly releated to compositing, also it includes match moving, knowing CV will make you understand camera tracking throughoutly, and there is many many more.
